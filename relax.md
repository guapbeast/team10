# Popular US Travel Destinations

![Newport dock](https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-content--1x-1/0b/17/3a/80.jpg)
## Newport, Rhode Island
> Newport is a ritzy weekend escape for all sorts. Girlfriends flit through the upscale shops that line Thames Street, while sailing crews take over Narragansett Bay in preparation for one of the many regattas. And like every other New England seaside destination, this port town is happy to provide a simple seafood lunch and a day at the beach. But what really calls tourists to Newport is the architecture: The 19th-century summer "cottages" on the shore and the colonial-era buildings downtown give the city an Old World, blue blood appearance. This port town's simple, seashore elegance is worth the splurge.

## Savannah, Georgia
> Savannah, with its Spanish moss, Southern accents and creepy graveyards, is a lot like Charleston, South Carolina with an eccentric streak. Savannah College of Art and Design students mix with ghost hunters and preservationists, while Southern restaurants share street blocks with edgy cafes and restored theaters. The city's antebellum past seeps from nearly every corner – it's home to one of the oldest Black churches in North America and Fort Pulaski acted as a safe haven for enslaved people to escape to freedom. But regardless of if you're in town to immerse yourself in history, see the sights, sample the tasty Southern cuisine or spend a few nights bar-hopping, Savannah knows how to show visitors a good time.

## Seattle, Washington
> Seattle's laid-back attitude and diverse neighborhoods more than make up for its consistently cloudy weather. Plus, it's home to some of the country's best coffee and a thriving arts scene, plenty of history, culture and – when the weather permits – some exciting outdoor activities such as kayaking, hiking, and whale watching. Not only that, but the nearby Olympic Mountains and the giant Mount Rainier are visible from many spots in the city; ski slopes are just a short drive away. Art lovers will appreciate the glass-blown pieces at Chihuly Garden and Glass as well as the works on display at the Seattle Art Museum. Maritime enthusiasts can explore the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks and watch the ships putter by.

# Underrated US Travel Destinations

![beach](https://d6qyz3em3b312.cloudfront.net/upload/images/media/2012/06/16/shutterstock_1810681.1920x1080.jpg)
## Sanibel Island, Florida
> This is Florida's ultimate leave-your-worries-at-home destination. The southern part is awash in secluded beaches and laid-back, seaside stays at spots like the Sanibel Beach Resort (which even has its own tiki bar). The northern half of the island, meanwhile, is protected by the J.N. “Ding” Darling National Wildlife Refuge, where you can spot 250 species of birds, gators, and eagles along marshy trails. From here, it’s also an easy ride to other islands like nearby Captiva and Cayo Costa, where you’ll find a wealth of sandbars to snorkel through and even more idyllic, peaceful beaches to lounge on.

![Rock formations](https://blog.vriresorts.com/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Sedona%20Arizona.jpg)
## Sedona, Arizona
> Sedona is regularly described as one of America's most beautiful places. The towering red rocks and jagged sandstone buttes matched against an almost always blue sky have beckoned to professional and budding artists for years. But there's more to Sedona than red rocks and good looks. Over the past few decades, spiritualists have flocked to the region to take advantage of the numerous New Age "vortexes" with supposed spirit-balancing powers found here. Spas offer traditional treatments with a local twist – such as red clay wraps and blue corn body scrubs – followed by a glass of local wine are great ways to relax after a long day spent on the trails. Exploring the wilderness via a guided Jeep tour is another popular option.

## Austin, Texas
> Known as the "Live Music Capital of the World," Austin boasts more live music venues per capita than anywhere else in the nation. It has witnessed the early careers of several famous musicians, including Stevie Ray Vaughan, Janis Joplin and the Dixie Chicks. Aside from its buzzing live music and nightlife scenes, the main reason to visit is to enjoy the outdoors. There's something here for everybody: Whether you're a history buff (LBJ's library is here as well as the Lone Star State-sized Texas State History Museum) an art lover (Blanton Museum of Art), a sports fan (University of Texas at Austin football) or a budding musician (Sixth Street).
